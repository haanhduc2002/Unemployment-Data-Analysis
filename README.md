# Unemployment-Data-Analysis
## Introduction

This project is my personal project to visualize unemployment rate in countries from 1991 to 2021 dataset on Kaggle.

In this project, I process and visualize the data using plotly a popular data visualization python library .

Different versions of the notebook notebook where I visualize the data set can be found on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1CMVaStWbFMBAdRODyfH882taOfr9nUzl?authuser=3#scrollTo=WThM9OV-Usgw) and [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/anhduchada/unemploymentratevisualization).

## Modules used

Data manipulation: [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), 

Data visualization: [plotly](https://plotly.com/)

Country Data: [pycountry](https://pypi.org/project/pycountry/)
## Demonstration

For demostration purposes, it is highly recommended that users run the version on Kaggle. For the version on Google Colab, it is required that you must have a google account and a google drive store your kaggle.json file.

You can download kaggle.json file using the following step:

1. Go to your account, Scroll to API section and Click Expire API Token to remove previous tokens

2. Click on Create New API Token - It will download kaggle.json file on your machine.

After the downloading process, you just need to upload the file to your Google Drive without having to put in any sub folders.
